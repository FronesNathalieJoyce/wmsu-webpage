	<p>The Western Mindanao State University (WMSU) yet again showed how serious the university is towards being a more eco-friendly and sustainable university. WMSU officially launched the additional 400 Kilowatts (KW) renewable Energy Solar Facility last November 27, 2019 at Dr. Bruno Juanitoa Gymnasium.</p>
	<p> Dr. Milabel E. Ho, WMSU President said that the additional 400 KW energy will be very beneficial to the whole WMSU community as it reduces the cost of the monthly payment in electricity and reduces the effects of climate change. Moreover, she emphasized that every one of us has a role in conserving not only in the consumption of electricity but also in the consumption of water.</p>
